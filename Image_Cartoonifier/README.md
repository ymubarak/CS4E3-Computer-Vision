# Image Cartoonifier: Applying Image Processing Filters For Image Cartoonifying

In this problem set we want to make the real-world images look like they are genuinely from
a cartoon. The basic idea is to fill the flat parts with some color and then draw thick lines on
the strong edges. In other words, the flat areas should become much more flat and the edges
should become much more distinct. We will detect edges and smooth the flat areas, then draw
enhanced edges back on top to produce a cartoon or comic book effect.  

This problem set will cover:
- Applying image processing filters for image smoothing and edge detection.
- Converting a real-life image to a sketch drawing.
- Converting a real-life image to a painting and overlaying the sketch to produce a cartoon.  

The following screenshots show the final output for the image cartoonifier program:
